# Phase 2: Audio Processing Pipeline - Open Questions for Refinement

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Model Selection

### HuggingFace Model Choice
- **Model Performance Trade-offs**:
  - Whisper vs Wav2Vec2 vs SpeechT5 for accuracy vs speed?
  - Model size considerations for server deployment (base vs large vs huge)?
  - Language support requirements beyond English?
  - Handling of different audio qualities and background noise?

- **Model Deployment**:
  - Local model hosting vs HuggingFace Inference API?
  - GPU requirements and cost implications?
  - Model caching and loading strategies for multiple concurrent requests?
  - Model version management and updates?

### Audio Format Support
- **Input Format Handling**:
  - Which audio formats to support (WAV, MP3, AAC, M4A, OGG)?
  - Audio quality requirements and preprocessing needs?
  - Should we standardize on one format or support multiple?
  - Audio compression before STT processing?

- **Audio Preprocessing**:
  - Noise reduction and audio enhancement requirements?
  - Audio segmentation for long recordings (>30 minutes)?
  - Speaker diarization for multiple speakers?
  - Handling of silence and background noise?

## Processing Pipeline Architecture

### Job Queue System
- **Queue Implementation**:
  - Celery vs Python-RQ vs custom async processing?
  - Task prioritization for premium vs free users?
  - Batch processing vs individual file processing?
  - Dead letter queue handling for failed transcriptions?

- **Worker Management**:
  - Number of worker processes for STT tasks?
  - Worker auto-scaling based on queue depth?
  - Resource allocation per worker (CPU, memory, GPU)?
  - Worker health monitoring and restart policies?

### Progress Tracking & Status Updates
- **Real-time Updates**:
  - WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events for progress updates?
  - Progress granularity (file-level vs chunk-level)?
  - Status persistence strategy for connection drops?
  - Mobile app notification integration?

- **Processing States**:
  - What are all possible processing states (uploaded, queued, processing, transcribing, completed, failed)?
  - Error state handling and user communication?
  - Retry logic for transient failures?
  - Manual intervention triggers for stuck jobs?

## Storage & Data Management

### Audio File Storage
- **Storage Strategy**:
  - Local filesystem vs object storage (S3, GCS)?
  - Integration with Firebase Storage or separate system?
  - File organization structure (user-based, date-based)?
  - Temporary vs permanent storage for different processing stages?

- **Storage Optimization**:
  - Audio compression for long-term storage?
  - Cleanup policies for processed files?
  - Backup and redundancy requirements?
  - Content delivery network (CDN) for audio playback?

### Transcript Storage
- **Data Structure**:
  - Raw transcript vs structured (with timestamps, confidence scores)?
  - Metadata storage (processing time, model used, quality metrics)?
  - Version control for transcript corrections?
  - Search indexing strategy for transcript content?

- **Database Design**:
  - PostgreSQL schema for transcript data?
  - Relationship modeling between audio files and transcripts?
  - Indexing strategy for fast text search?
  - Archival strategy for old transcripts?

## Performance & Scalability

### Processing Performance
- **Resource Optimization**:
  - Concurrent STT processing limits per server?
  - Memory management for large audio files?
  - GPU sharing strategies for multiple models?
  - Caching strategies for repeated processing?

- **Quality vs Speed Trade-offs**:
  - Different quality tiers for transcription (fast vs accurate)?
  - User choice for processing priority?
  - Background processing vs on-demand processing?
  - Processing time estimation and communication?

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Failure Scenarios**:
  - Handling of corrupted or invalid audio files?
  - STT model failures and fallback strategies?
  - Network failures during processing?
  - Disk space and resource exhaustion?

- **Recovery Mechanisms**:
  - Automatic retry policies with exponential backoff?
  - Manual retry capabilities for users?
  - Partial processing recovery for large files?
  - Error reporting and debugging information?

## Integration & API Design

### Mobile App Integration
- **Upload API Design**:
  - Chunked upload for large files with resume capability?
  - Upload progress tracking and cancellation?
  - Audio format validation before processing?
  - Bandwidth optimization for mobile networks?

- **Status API Design**:
  - Polling vs push notifications for status updates?
  - Batch status queries for multiple files?
  - Historical processing status retention?
  - Error details and user-friendly messages?

### Quality Assurance
- **Transcript Quality**:
  - Confidence scoring and quality metrics?
  - User feedback mechanisms for transcript accuracy?
  - A/B testing different STT models?
  - Quality benchmarking and monitoring?

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Audio File Security**:
  - Encryption at rest for audio files?
  - Secure deletion after processing?
  - Access control and user isolation?
  - Audit logging for file access?

- **Processing Security**:
  - Secure model execution environment?
  - Data leakage prevention between users?
  - Model output sanitization?
  - Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA) considerations?

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Processing Metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Processing time tracking per file size?
  - Model accuracy metrics and drift detection?
  - Resource utilization monitoring?
  - User satisfaction and usage patterns?

- **Business Metrics**:
  - Processing volume and growth tracking?
  - Cost per transcription analysis?
  - User conversion from free to paid tiers?
  - Feature usage analytics?
