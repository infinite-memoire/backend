# Phase 1: Backend Foundation - Open Questions for Refinement

## Technology Stack & Framework Selection

### Python Web Framework
- **FastAPI vs Django vs Flask**: Which framework best suits our needs for:
  - High-performance audio file handling?
  - WebSocket support for real-time progress updates?
  - Built-in async support for long-running AI processing?
  - API documentation and testing capabilities?

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL configuration**: 
  - What specific schemas do we need for users, audio metadata, processing jobs?
  - Should we use separate databases for operational vs analytical data?
  - What indexing strategy for audio file lookups and user queries?

- **Neo4j integration**:
  - How do we handle the dual database setup (PostgreSQL + Neo4j)?
  - What's the data synchronization strategy between relational and graph data?
  - Should user authentication data live in PostgreSQL only?

### Authentication & Security
- **Firebase Integration**: 
  - How do we validate Firebase JWT tokens on the backend?
  - Should we replicate user data in PostgreSQL or query Firebase on each request?
  - What's the strategy for handling Firebase service account credentials?

- **API Security**:
  - Rate limiting requirements for audio upload endpoints?
  - File upload size limits and validation rules?
  - CORS configuration for mobile app integration?

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### Environment Management
- **Development vs Production**:
  - How many environments do we need (dev/staging/prod)?
  - Should we use Docker containers for local development?
  - What's the database seeding strategy for different environments?

### File Storage Strategy
- **Audio File Storage**:
  - Local filesystem vs cloud storage (S3, GCS) for audio files?
  - Should we integrate with Firebase Storage or use separate storage?
  - What's the backup and disaster recovery strategy?
  - File retention policies and cleanup strategies?

### Performance & Scalability
- **Async Processing**:
  - Celery vs FastAPI BackgroundTasks vs custom job queue?
  - Redis vs RabbitMQ for job queuing?
  - How do we handle job persistence and failure recovery?

## API Design & Integration

### Mobile App Integration
- **API Endpoints Structure**:
  - RESTful vs GraphQL for complex data relationships?
  - WebSocket endpoints for real-time progress updates?
  - Pagination strategy for large datasets (stories, recordings)?

### Audio Processing Pipeline
- **File Upload Handling**:
  - Streaming upload for large files vs chunked upload?
  - Progress tracking and resume capability for failed uploads?
  - Audio format validation and conversion pipeline?

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- **Test Coverage Requirements**:
  - Unit test coverage targets for each component?
  - Integration test strategy for database operations?
  - End-to-end test strategy with mobile app integration?

### Code Organization
- **Project Structure**:
  - Monolithic vs microservices architecture?
  - How to organize models, services, and API routes?
  - Dependency injection pattern for services?

## Configuration & Secrets Management
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Which configuration values should be environment-specific?
  - How to handle sensitive data (API keys, database passwords)?
  - Local development setup for team members?

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Observability Requirements**:
  - What metrics should we track (API response times, upload speeds)?
  - Logging strategy for debugging and monitoring?
  - Error tracking and alerting requirements?

## Migration & Data Management
- **Database Migrations**:
  - Alembic for PostgreSQL schema migrations?
  - How to handle Neo4j schema changes and data migrations?
  - Data backup and restore procedures?

## Questions Requiring Immediate Decision
1. **Primary web framework choice** - impacts all subsequent architecture decisions
2. **Database connection strategy** - affects performance and complexity
3. **File storage location** - impacts deployment and scaling strategy
4. **Authentication flow** - must align with mobile app implementation
5. **Development environment setup** - needed for team productivity
