## Phase 2: Audio Processing Pipeline - Open Questions for Refinement

### Speech-to-Text (STT) Model Selection

This is a critical decision, impacting accuracy, speed, and cost.

#### HuggingFace Model Choice

* **Model Performance Trade-offs (Whisper vs. Wav2Vec2 vs. SpeechT5 for accuracy vs. speed?)**
    * **Whisper (OpenAI/HuggingFace):** Generally considered the state-of-the-art for out-of-the-box accuracy across many languages and domains. It's an encoder-decoder Transformer model trained on a massive dataset (680,000 hours). It handles various audio conditions well. However, it can be computationally intensive, especially larger models.
    * **Wav2Vec2 (Meta AI/HuggingFace):** A self-supervised model that learns powerful speech representations. It can achieve very high accuracy, especially when fine-tuned on domain-specific data. It's often faster than Whisper for comparable accuracy on some tasks, and smaller versions can be very efficient. Wav2Vec2-BERT is a newer iteration showing strong performance.
    * **SpeechT5 (Microsoft/HuggingFace):** A multi-task model that can handle STT, text-to-speech, and more. While versatile, for pure STT, Whisper or Wav2Vec2 might offer more focused optimization and better out-of-the-box performance or fine-tuning potential. Its multi-task nature might add overhead if only STT is needed.
    * **Recommendation:**
        * **Start with Whisper (medium or large-v2):** For initial prototyping and general-purpose use, Whisper offers excellent accuracy with minimal effort. It's a strong baseline to compare against.
        * **Explore Wav2Vec2 for optimization and fine-tuning:** If you find Whisper is too slow or resource-intensive for your specific use cases, or if you have domain-specific audio data that could benefit from fine-tuning, Wav2Vec2 (e.g., a well-performing Wav2Vec2-BERT variant) can be highly performant and cost-effective.

* **Model size considerations for server deployment (base vs. large vs. huge?)**
    * **Smaller models (base/small):** Faster inference, lower memory footprint, suitable for CPU-only deployment or limited GPU resources. Accuracy might be slightly lower.
    * **Larger models (large/huge):** Higher accuracy, especially for challenging audio or diverse language, but require more powerful GPUs and more memory.
    * **Recommendation:** Begin with a **`medium` or `large-v2` Whisper model**. Monitor performance and resource usage. If accuracy is sufficient and performance acceptable, stick with it. If not, consider `huge` for higher accuracy (with increased resource demands) or explore smaller, faster Wav2Vec2 models with potential fine-tuning. For industrial affordability, finding the smallest model that meets accuracy requirements is key.

* **Language support requirements beyond English?**
    * **Whisper:** Excellent multilingual support out-of-the-box, trained on diverse languages.
    * **Wav2Vec2:** Many pre-trained multilingual Wav2Vec2 models exist, and it's also highly effective for fine-tuning on specific languages, including low-resource ones.
    * **SpeechT5:** Also offers multilingual capabilities.
    * **Recommendation:** If multiple languages are a core requirement, **Whisper is a strong initial choice due to its broad multilingual training**. If you need extremely high accuracy for a *specific* non-English language and have data for it, fine-tuning a Wav2Vec2 model could yield superior results.

* **Handling of different audio qualities and background noise?**
    * All these models have some robustness to noise due to their large training datasets.
    * **Whisper:** Generally performs well on noisy audio due to its extensive training data.
    * **Wav2Vec2:** Can also be robust, and fine-tuning on noisy datasets can further improve its performance in such conditions.
    * **Preprocessing:** While models are robust, **some basic preprocessing (like normalization) is often beneficial**. Aggressive noise reduction can sometimes remove speech cues, so it's a trade-off. It's often better to let the model handle some noise.

#### Model Deployment

* **Local model hosting vs. HuggingFace Inference API?**
    * **Local Model Hosting:**
        * **Pros:** Full control over infrastructure, potentially lower long-term cost for high volume, reduced latency (no network roundtrip to HuggingFace), data privacy (data stays on your servers).
        * **Cons:** Requires managing GPU infrastructure (purchase/rent, setup, maintenance), expertise in model serving (e.g., FastAPI integration, ONNX Runtime, TorchServe), scaling challenges.
    * **HuggingFace Inference API:**
        * **Pros:** Simplest to get started, no infrastructure management, pay-as-you-go, potentially faster time to market.
        * **Cons:** Can become expensive at high volumes, data privacy concerns (data sent to HuggingFace), network latency, reliance on an external service.
    * **Recommendation:**
        * **Start with local hosting if feasible.** Given you already have a backend repository and are building a comprehensive system, local hosting offers better long-term cost-effectiveness and control for an industrial application.
        * **Consider a hybrid approach initially:** Use HuggingFace Inference API for small-scale testing and rapid prototyping, then transition to local hosting for production.
        * **For cost-effective industrial practice, local hosting with optimized inference (e.g., ONNX Runtime, quantization) is generally preferred.**

* **GPU requirements and cost implications?**
    * **GPU is highly recommended for performance.** CPU-only inference, especially for larger models or long audio files, will be significantly slower and more expensive in terms of CPU hours.
    * **Cost:**
        * **Cloud GPUs (AWS, GCP, Azure):** Pay-per-hour. Consider instance types with NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., V100, A100 for high performance; T4 for more cost-effective options).
        * **On-premise GPUs:** Higher upfront cost, but no recurring hourly fees. Requires dedicated hardware and maintenance.
    * **Affordability:** Start with smaller GPU instances (e.g., a single T4) and scale as needed. **Batching** (processing multiple audio files simultaneously on the GPU) is crucial for maximizing GPU utilization and cost efficiency.

* **Model caching and loading strategies for multiple concurrent requests?**
    * **Load model once:** The STT model should be loaded into GPU memory (or CPU memory if no GPU) once at application startup. Re-loading for each request is highly inefficient.
    * **Shared instance:** Use a single, shared instance of the loaded model across all worker processes or threads to serve requests. This is where a framework like FastAPI with its async capabilities is beneficial.
    * **Queueing:** Implement an internal queue if the rate of incoming requests exceeds the model's processing capacity to prevent overloading and ensure stable performance.

* **Model version management and updates?**
    * **Containerization (Docker):** Package your application with specific model versions in Docker images. This ensures reproducibility and simplifies deployment.
    * **Model Registry (e.g., MLflow, DVC):** For more mature MLOps, use a model registry to track different model versions, their performance, and facilitate rollbacks/rollforwards.
    * **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests for new model versions to ensure they meet accuracy and performance benchmarks before deployment.

### Audio Format Support

* **Input Format Handling (WAV, MP3, AAC, M4A, OGG)?**
    * **Support multiple common formats:** MP3, WAV, M4A are widely used.
    * **Standardization vs. Multiple:** It's best to support multiple common input formats to reduce user friction.
    * **Internal Standardization:** Internally, convert all incoming audio to a standardized format (e.g., 16kHz, 16-bit PCM WAV) *before* feeding it to the STT model. This simplifies the STT model's input pipeline and ensures consistent processing. Libraries like `pydub` (for easy conversion) and `librosa` or `torchaudio` (for direct loading and resampling) are useful.

* **Audio quality requirements and preprocessing needs?**
    * **Sampling Rate:** Most STT models perform best with audio sampled at 16kHz. If input audio has a different sample rate, **resample it to 16kHz**.
    * **Bit Depth:** 16-bit PCM is standard.
    * **Preprocessing:**
        * **Normalization:** Crucial for consistent model input, ensuring audio loudness is within a specific range.
        * **Silence Removal (VAD - Voice Activity Detection):** Can improve efficiency for very long recordings with significant silent portions by not processing silence. However, be cautious not to remove important context.
        * **Noise Reduction:** Generally, **avoid aggressive noise reduction** unless absolutely necessary. Modern STT models are often trained on noisy data and perform better without pre-filtering, as filters can sometimes distort speech.
        * **Recommendation:** Focus on **resampling and normalization** as primary preprocessing steps. Evaluate VAD and noise reduction sparingly.

* **Audio compression before STT processing?**
    * **Yes, for transfer, but decompress before STT.** Compress files for efficient upload and storage (e.g., MP3, AAC). However, STT models typically operate on uncompressed audio waveforms. So, decompress the audio to raw PCM (e.g., WAV) before passing it to the model.

* **Audio Preprocessing (Noise reduction, audio enhancement, segmentation, speaker diarization, handling silence/background noise)?**
    * **Noise reduction & enhancement:** As noted, generally minimal; models handle some noise.
    * **Audio segmentation for long recordings (>30 minutes):** **Absolutely essential.** Processing very long audio files (e.g., hours long) in one go is memory-intensive and can lead to performance issues or out-of-memory errors.
        * **Strategy:** Break long audio into manageable chunks (e.g., 15-30 seconds, potentially with a small overlap to capture context across chunk boundaries). Process each chunk, then stitch the transcripts back together.
        * **Libraries:** `pydub` for chunking.
    * **Speaker diarization for multiple speakers?**
        * **Highly Recommended for meeting/interview transcription.** This identifies "who spoke when." It's a separate ML task.
        * **Integration:** Can be run *after* the initial STT, or some advanced models integrate it (e.g., some Whisper variants or dedicated diarization models on HuggingFace like `pyannote/speaker-diarization`).
        * **Complexity:** Adds significant complexity to the pipeline. Consider it for a later iteration if initial focus is on basic transcription.
    * **Handling of silence and background noise:** As mentioned, VAD can help with silence. Models handle some background noise.

### Processing Pipeline Architecture

#### Job Queue System

* **Queue Implementation (Celery vs. Python-RQ vs. custom async processing?)**
    * **Celery:**
        * **Pros:** Very mature, feature-rich (task retries, scheduling, rate limiting, monitoring tools), supports various brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis, SQS, etc.), widely adopted in production.
        * **Cons:** Can be complex to set up and configure initially, especially for smaller projects.
    * **Python-RQ (Redis Queue):**
        * **Pros:** Simpler to set up and use (Redis as broker), lightweight, good for smaller to medium-sized projects or when Redis is already in your stack.
        * **Cons:** Fewer features than Celery (e.g., no built-in scheduler, less flexible retries), tied to Redis.
    * **Custom async processing:**
        * **Pros:** Full control, no external dependencies (beyond basic async libraries).
        * **Cons:** Requires significant development effort for features like retries, error handling, worker management, and monitoring. Re-inventing the wheel.
    * **Recommendation:**
        * For an industrial backend, **Celery is generally the most robust and scalable choice**. Its feature set (retries, monitoring) is invaluable for a production-grade audio processing pipeline.
        * If Redis is already central to your architecture and you want a lighter solution, Python-RQ is a viable alternative for simpler needs, but be prepared to build out some missing features yourself.

* **Task prioritization for premium vs. free users?**
    * **Celery:** Supports this well. You can define multiple queues (e.g., `high_priority_queue`, `low_priority_queue`) and configure workers to prioritize certain queues or process them round-robin. Premium users' tasks go to `high_priority_queue`.
    * **Python-RQ:** Also supports multiple queues and workers listening to them in a defined order.
    * **Mechanism:** When a user uploads audio, based on their subscription tier, enqueue their transcription task into the appropriate priority queue.

* **Batch processing vs. individual file processing?**
    * **Batch processing:** **Highly recommended for efficiency, especially with GPUs.** Group multiple smaller audio files or chunks from the same user (or different users, carefully considering privacy) into a single batch to feed to the STT model. This maximizes GPU utilization and reduces overhead.
    * **Individual file processing:** Simpler to manage but less efficient for large volumes.
    * **Strategy:** The job queue system should facilitate both. For smaller files, process individually. For large files, break into chunks and batch process those chunks. For general throughput, batch multiple small user requests together if the model supports it.

* **Dead letter queue handling for failed transcriptions?**
    * **Absolutely essential.** When a transcription fails after retries, send it to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
    * **Purpose:** The DLQ allows you to inspect failed messages, debug the cause of failure, and potentially reprocess them manually or with a fixed pipeline. Prevents lost data and provides valuable insights into recurring issues.
    * **Celery/RabbitMQ/Redis:** Many brokers support DLQs natively or can be configured to do so.

#### Worker Management

* **Number of worker processes for STT tasks?**
    * **Determined by CPU/GPU resources:** Start with a few workers per server (e.g., 1-2 per GPU if using GPUs, or `num_cores - 1` if CPU-only, leaving one for other system tasks).
    * **Monitor resource utilization:** Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) to observe CPU, memory, and GPU usage. Adjust worker count based on saturation and latency.
    * **Concurrency:** STT models are usually best utilized by processing multiple chunks concurrently. The number of workers, combined with the batch size, determines the overall concurrency.

* **Worker auto-scaling based on queue depth?**
    * **Crucial for scalability and cost-effectiveness.**
    * **Mechanism:** Integrate with cloud auto-scaling groups (AWS Auto Scaling, GCP Managed Instance Groups, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
    * **Metrics:** Scale workers up when the queue depth (number of pending tasks) exceeds a threshold and scale down when it's low. This prevents over-provisioning and saves costs.

* **Resource allocation per worker (CPU, memory, GPU)?**
    * **Memory:** STT models can be memory-intensive, especially larger models. Allocate enough RAM per worker.
    * **CPU:** Needed for I/O, preprocessing, and orchestrating GPU inference.
    * **GPU:** Assign dedicated GPUs or portions of GPUs to workers. For shared GPUs, ensure proper resource management to avoid contention.
    * **Tuning:** This is an iterative process. Start with reasonable defaults and tune based on monitoring data.

* **Worker health monitoring and restart policies?**
    * **Monitoring:** Use metrics (e.g., worker heartbeats, task success/failure rates, processing times) to detect unhealthy workers.
    * **Restart policies:** Configure your worker management system (e.g., Kubernetes, systemd, supervisor) to automatically restart failed workers. Implement exponential backoff for retries to avoid continuous crashing.
    * **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical worker failures or high error rates.

### Progress Tracking & Status Updates

* **Real-time Updates (WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events for progress updates?)**
    * **WebSockets:**
        * **Pros:** Full-duplex (bidirectional) communication, lower overhead after handshake, ideal for interactive, real-time applications where both client and server send messages.
        * **Cons:** More complex to implement than SSE, requires managing persistent connections.
    * **Server-Sent Events (SSE):**
        * **Pros:** Simpler to implement for server-to-client updates, built-in reconnection logic in browsers, works over standard HTTP/1.1 (less firewall issues).
        * **Cons:** Unidirectional (server to client only), not suitable for client-initiated real-time interactions beyond initial connection.
    * **Recommendation:**
        * For progress updates that are primarily server-to-client, **SSE is often simpler and sufficient.** It's a good choice for status updates like "uploaded," "processing," "transcribing," "completed."
        * If you anticipate more interactive real-time features in the future (e.g., real-time editing of transcripts as they appear), **WebSockets offer more flexibility.** You could start with SSE and migrate to WebSockets if bidirectional communication becomes a strong requirement.

* **Progress granularity (file-level vs. chunk-level)?**
    * **File-level:** Simplest. Update status for the whole file (e.g., "50% complete").
    * **Chunk-level:** Provides more granular feedback (e.g., "Chunk 1/10 processed").
    * **Recommendation:** **Start with file-level progress for simplicity.** If users demand more granular feedback (especially for very long audio files), implement chunk-level progress. This might involve tracking individual chunk statuses in the database and aggregating them for the overall file progress.

* **Status persistence strategy for connection drops?**
    * **Database:** The primary source of truth for processing status should be your database (PostgreSQL in your case).
    * **Mechanism:** When a client reconnects, they should fetch the latest status from the database. The real-time updates (SSE/WebSocket) are for *pushing* changes, but the database stores the *current state*.
    * **Job Queue Integration:** The job queue system (Celery) should update the database at key stages (e.g., task started, chunk completed, task failed, task succeeded).

* **Mobile app notification integration?**
    * **Push Notifications:** For background processing, integrate with mobile push notification services (Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android/iOS, or Apple Push Notification Service for iOS).
    * **Triggers:** Send a push notification when a transcription job moves to "completed" or "failed."

* **Processing States (uploaded, queued, processing, transcribing, completed, failed)?**
    * **Yes, these are good starting states.**
    * **Refinements:**
        * `uploaded`: File received and stored.
        * `queued`: Task submitted to the job queue.
        * `downloading`: (If processing from external storage like S3)
        * `preprocessing`: Audio is being normalized, chunked, etc.
        * `transcribing`: STT model is actively processing audio chunks.
        * `post_processing`: (If speaker diarization, formatting, etc., happens after raw STT).
        * `completed`: Transcription successful.
        * `failed`: Transcription failed (with an associated error reason).
        * `cancelled`: User cancelled the job.
    * **Error state handling and user communication?**
        * Provide specific error messages to the user (e.g., "Unsupported audio format," "Processing failed due to corrupted file," "Server busy, please retry").
        * Store detailed error logs internally for debugging.
    * **Retry logic for transient failures?**
        * **Built into Celery:** Configure automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary resource unavailability). This prevents a single hiccup from failing an entire job.
    * **Manual intervention triggers for stuck jobs?**
        * Implement a dashboard or admin interface to monitor job statuses.
        * Allow administrators to manually mark jobs as failed, re-queue them, or cancel them.
        * Set up alerts for jobs that remain in a "processing" state for an unusually long time.

### Storage & Data Management

#### Audio File Storage

* **Storage Strategy (Local filesystem vs. object storage (S3, GCS)?**
    * **Object Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage):**
        * **Pros:** **Highly recommended for industrial applications.** Scalable, durable, cost-effective for large volumes of unstructured data, built-in redundancy, easier integration with cloud services (CDN, processing).
        * **Cons:** Network latency for access (though often negligible for large files), requires integration with cloud APIs.
    * **Local Filesystem:**
        * **Pros:** Simplest for development, fastest access if on the same machine.
        * **Cons:** Not scalable, poor redundancy, difficult to manage across multiple servers/workers, single point of failure.
    * **Recommendation:** **Use object storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).** This provides the scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness needed for handling potentially large numbers of audio files.

* **Integration with Firebase Storage or separate system?**
    * If your mobile app relies heavily on Firebase, Firebase Storage could be an option for **uploads from the mobile app**.
    * However, for backend processing, it's often more flexible to use a dedicated object storage solution (S3/GCS) that integrates well with your backend infrastructure and chosen cloud provider. You can still use Firebase Storage for uploads, and then have a process that moves or copies the files to your main object storage for processing.
    * **Recommendation:** Use **S3/GCS** for the backend's primary audio storage.

* **File organization structure (user-based, date-based)?**
    * **Combination:** A user-based (e.g., `user_id/`) and then date-based or unique ID-based structure is common: `bucket_name/user_id/yyyy-mm-dd/audio_file_uuid.mp3`.
    * **Purpose:** Facilitates user-specific data retrieval, lifecycle management, and simplifies clean-up policies.

* **Temporary vs. permanent storage for different processing stages?**
    * **Temporary:** Input audio can be temporarily stored in a "staging" bucket or folder upon upload, then moved to a "processed" or "archive" bucket after transcription.
    * **Permanent:** Transcripts and final processed audio (if retained) should be in permanent storage.
    * **Lifecycle Policies:** Object storage allows defining lifecycle policies to automatically move data to colder storage tiers (e.g., S3 Glacier) or delete it after a certain period, which is crucial for cost optimization.

#### Storage Optimization

* **Audio compression for long-term storage?**
    * **Yes.** After transcription, if you need to store the original audio, compress it to a space-efficient lossy format like **MP3** or **AAC** if the original was lossless, or a high-quality lossy format if the original was already lossy. This significantly reduces storage costs. Keep a copy of the original (if possible and feasible) if highest fidelity is required for any future re-processing.

* **Cleanup policies for processed files?**
    * **Crucial for cost management and privacy.** Define clear policies:
        * How long to keep original audio after transcription (e.g., 7 days, 30 days, or only until transcription is complete and delivered).
        * Whether to delete completely or move to archival storage.
    * **Automation:** Use object storage lifecycle policies for automatic deletion or tiering.

* **Backup and redundancy requirements?**
    * Object storage provides high durability and redundancy by default (e.g., S3's 11 nines of durability).
    * For critical data, consider cross-region replication or separate backup strategies, but for most audio files, the built-in redundancy is sufficient.

* **Content delivery network (CDN) for audio playback?**
    * **Yes, if users will directly play back the transcribed audio files from your system.** CDNs (CloudFront, Cloudflare) improve latency and reduce load on your origin server by caching content closer to users.

#### Transcript Storage

* **Data Structure (Raw transcript vs. structured (with timestamps, confidence scores)?)**
    * **Structured is essential for rich features.** Store:
        * `raw_text`: The full transcribed text.
        * `word_level_timestamps`: Array of objects, each with `word`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `confidence_score`. This is invaluable for highlighting words, jumping to specific parts of audio, and editing.
        * `speaker_labels`: If diarization is implemented (e.g., `speaker_1`, `speaker_2`).
        * `confidence_score_overall`: Overall confidence for the transcription.
        * `processing_metadata`: (e.g., `model_used`, `processing_time`, `audio_quality_metrics`).
    * **Recommendation:** **Always store structured data with word-level timestamps.** This unlocks many future features.

* **Metadata storage (processing time, model used, quality metrics)?**
    * **Yes, store all relevant metadata** in the transcript record. This is crucial for:
        * Debugging and error analysis.
        * Tracking model performance and A/B testing.
        * Billing (if relevant, e.g., processing time).
        * Auditing.

* **Version control for transcript corrections?**
    * If users can edit transcripts, you'll need version control.
    * **Simple approach:** Store multiple versions in the database, perhaps with a `version_number` and `is_current` flag.
    * **More advanced:** Use a separate versioning system or database features like "temporal tables" if your database supports them.

* **Search indexing strategy for transcript content?**
    * **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search:** PostgreSQL has excellent built-in full-text search capabilities (`tsvector`, `tsquery`). This can be sufficient for many use cases.
    * **Dedicated Search Engine (Elasticsearch, Solr):** For very large volumes of transcripts, complex search queries, or high search throughput, a dedicated search engine is more powerful.
    * **Recommendation:** **Start with PostgreSQL's full-text search.** It's often surprisingly capable and avoids adding another complex dependency. Migrate to a dedicated search engine if performance or feature requirements demand it.

#### Database Design

* **PostgreSQL schema for transcript data?**
    * **`audio_files` table:**
        * `id` (PK)
        * `user_id` (FK to users table)
        * `original_filename`
        * `storage_path` (S3 URL or similar)
        * `file_size_bytes`
        * `duration_seconds`
        * `upload_timestamp`
        * `status` (enum: `uploaded`, `queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
        * `error_message` (TEXT, nullable)
        * `last_updated`
    * **`transcriptions` table:**
        * `id` (PK)
        * `audio_file_id` (FK to `audio_files` table)
        * `raw_text` (TEXT)
        * `word_timestamps` (JSONB - for flexibility in storing word, start, end, confidence, speaker info)
        * `overall_confidence` (NUMERIC)
        * `model_used` (VARCHAR)
        * `processing_time_seconds` (NUMERIC)
        * `transcription_timestamp`
        * `version` (INTEGER, for corrections)
        * `is_current_version` (BOOLEAN)
        * `metadata` (JSONB, for additional flexible metadata)
    * **Indices:** Index `user_id` on `audio_files`, `audio_file_id` on `transcriptions`. Add a Gin index for `raw_text` if using PostgreSQL full-text search.

* **Relationship modeling between audio files and transcripts?**
    * A one-to-many relationship: One `audio_file` can have many `transcriptions` (if supporting versioning or multiple processing attempts).
    * Foreign key `audio_file_id` in the `transcriptions` table referencing `audio_files.id`.

* **Indexing strategy for fast text search?**
    * **PostgreSQL `GIN` index on `tsvector` column:** Create a `tsvector` column for full-text search, populate it from `raw_text`, and index it with a GIN index.
    * `CREATE INDEX idx_transcriptions_raw_text_gin ON transcriptions USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', raw_text));`

* **Archival strategy for old transcripts?**
    * **Data retention policies:** Define how long to keep transcripts based on business needs and compliance (e.g., GDPR/CCPA).
    * **Soft delete:** Add an `is_deleted` column or `deleted_at` timestamp.
    * **Data warehousing:** For very old data, move it to a data warehouse (e.g., Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift) for analytics, where it's cheaper to store and less frequently accessed.
    * **Partitioning:** For very large tables, PostgreSQL partitioning can improve performance for queries on specific date ranges or user IDs.

### Performance & Scalability

#### Processing Performance

* **Resource Optimization (Concurrent STT processing limits per server?)**
    * **GPU memory limits:** The primary constraint will be GPU memory. Each STT model inference consumes a certain amount of VRAM. You can run multiple inferences concurrently on a single GPU until VRAM is saturated.
    * **Batch size:** Optimize the batch size for inference. Larger batches increase throughput but also VRAM usage. Find the sweet spot for your chosen model and GPU.
    * **CPU utilization:** Ensure CPU is not a bottleneck (for I/O, preprocessing, etc.).
    * **Monitoring:** Use GPU monitoring tools (e.g., `nvidia-smi`) and system monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) to identify bottlenecks.

* **Memory management for large audio files?**
    * **Chunking is key.** As discussed, break large files into smaller chunks to keep memory usage manageable.
    * **Stream processing:** If possible, stream audio directly from storage to the model without loading the entire file into memory.

* **GPU sharing strategies for multiple models?**
    * **Single model per GPU:** Simplest, often highest performance.
    * **Multiple models on one GPU:** Possible if models are small or GPU has ample VRAM. Requires careful management to avoid out-of-memory errors or contention. Tools like NVIDIA MPS (Multi-Process Service) can help, but add complexity.
    * **Recommendation:** Start with **one main STT model per dedicated GPU** for stability and performance.

* **Caching strategies for repeated processing?**
    * **If the *exact same* audio file is uploaded multiple times, return cached transcript.** Store a hash of the audio file to check for duplicates.
    * **Partial processing caching:** For very long files that are paused/resumed, store intermediate chunk results.
    * **Model weights caching:** The model weights themselves should be loaded once and kept in memory.

#### Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs

* **Different quality tiers for transcription (fast vs. accurate)?**
    * **Excellent idea for user choice.**
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Fast/Draft:** Use a smaller, faster STT model (e.g., Whisper base, or a faster Wav2Vec2 variant). Lower accuracy, but quicker results.
        * **Accurate/Premium:** Use a larger, more accurate STT model (e.g., Whisper large-v2, or a heavily fine-tuned Wav2Vec2). Slower, but higher quality.
    * **User Choice:** Allow users to select their desired tier.

* **User choice for processing priority?**
    * Directly ties into the job queue prioritization (premium vs. free users).

* **Background processing vs. on-demand processing?**
    * **Background processing:** For most transcriptions (e.g., long files), this is the default. Users submit, get a notification when done.
    * **On-demand/Streaming:** For very short audio or specific interactive use cases, near real-time (streaming) transcription might be needed. This is more complex to implement and often requires specific streaming STT models.
    * **Recommendation:** Focus on robust background processing first.

* **Processing time estimation and communication?**
    * **Estimate:** Based on audio duration, current queue depth, and historical processing times per model.
    * **Communicate:** Display estimated completion time to the user, and update it as processing progresses. This manages user expectations.

### Error Handling & Recovery

* **Failure Scenarios (Corrupted files, model failures, network failures, resource exhaustion)?**
    * **Corrupted/Invalid Audio:** Implement strict input validation (file headers, codecs, sample rate). Reject invalid files early with a clear error message.
    * **STT Model Failures:**
        * **Specific error codes:** Distinguish between model errors (e.g., out of memory during inference) and other errors.
        * **Fallback strategies:** If one model fails consistently, can you try a different, more robust (even if less accurate) model? (Advanced)
    * **Network Failures:**
        * **Retries for external calls:** When downloading audio from S3 or interacting with external APIs, implement retries with exponential backoff.
        * **Idempotent tasks:** Ensure tasks are designed so that retrying them doesn't cause side effects or data duplication.
    * **Disk Space/Resource Exhaustion:**
        * **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for low disk space, high CPU/memory usage.
        * **Graceful degradation:** If resources are critical, perhaps reject new tasks or switch to a lower quality/resource-intensive model temporarily.

* **Recovery Mechanisms (Automatic retry policies, manual retry, partial processing recovery, error reporting/debugging)?**
    * **Automatic Retry Policies:** As discussed, Celery's built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff are crucial.
    * **Manual Retry:** Admin interface for retrying failed jobs from the DLQ.
    * **Partial Processing Recovery:** For chunked processing, if a single chunk fails, retry only that chunk. If it repeatedly fails, mark the entire file as "partially failed" or move to DLQ. Store intermediate chunk results in the database.
    * **Error Reporting & Debugging:**
        * **Centralized Logging:** Use a logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog, Splunk) to collect logs from all components.
        * **Structured Logs:** Log errors with relevant context (user ID, audio file ID, error type, stack trace).
        * **Alerting:** Integrate with alert systems (PagerDuty, Slack, email) for critical errors.
        * **Monitoring Dashboard:** A dashboard showing error rates, failed jobs, and worker health.

### Integration & API Design

#### Mobile App Integration

* **Upload API Design (Chunked upload for large files, resume capability, progress tracking, format validation, bandwidth optimization)?**
    * **Chunked Upload (Resumable Uploads):** **Essential for large files.**
        * **Process:**
            1.  Client initiates upload, gets a unique upload ID.
            2.  Client divides file into chunks and uploads them sequentially or in parallel.
            3.  Server stores chunks and tracks progress for the upload ID.
            4.  If connection drops, client can query which chunks are missing and resume.
            5.  After all chunks are uploaded, client sends a "complete" request, and the server reassembles the file.
        * **Pre-signed URLs (S3):** For direct uploads to S3 from the client, use pre-signed URLs. Your backend generates a temporary, time-limited URL for the client to upload directly to S3. This offloads the upload burden from your backend. For chunked uploads, you'd generate a pre-signed URL for each chunk.
    * **Progress Tracking:** Client can poll the backend or subscribe to SSE/WebSocket updates for upload progress.
    * **Audio Format Validation:** Perform initial validation on the client-side (if possible) and robustly on the server-side before storing or processing.
    * **Bandwidth Optimization:** Ensure chunks are compressed during transfer.

* **Status API Design (Polling vs. push notifications, batch status queries, historical status retention, error details)?**
    * **Push Notifications:** Use for final status (completed/failed) for background tasks.
    * **Polling (for immediate status):** For ongoing progress, the mobile app can poll a `/status/{job_id}` endpoint.
    * **SSE/WebSockets (for real-time progress):** As discussed, preferred over polling for continuous updates.
    * **Batch Status Queries:** Allow users to request statuses for multiple jobs in one API call (`/status?job_ids=id1,id2,id3`).
    * **Historical Status Retention:** Keep a history of job statuses in the database, allowing users to view past transcriptions.
    * **Error Details:** Provide user-friendly error messages in the API response.

#### Quality Assurance

* **Transcript Quality (Confidence scoring, user feedback mechanisms, A/B testing, benchmarking)?**
    * **Confidence Scoring:** STT models provide confidence scores for words or the entire transcript. Store these. Use them to flag low-confidence sections for potential human review.
    * **User Feedback:** Implement a mechanism for users to rate transcriptions or report errors. This data is invaluable for model improvement (e.g., fine-tuning with user-corrected data).
    * **A/B Testing:** For evaluating new STT models or processing pipelines, A/B test them against current production. Split traffic and compare user feedback/internal metrics.
    * **Quality Benchmarking:** Periodically transcribe a known set of audio samples (with human-verified ground truth) and calculate Word Error Rate (WER) to track model performance over time.

### Security & Privacy

#### Data Protection

* **Audio File Security (Encryption at rest, secure deletion, access control, audit logging)?**
    * **Encryption at Rest:**
        * **Object Storage:** Cloud providers (S3, GCS) offer encryption at rest by default (SSE-S3) or with customer-managed keys (SSE-C, SSE-KMS). **Enable/configure this.**
        * **Database:** Enable encryption for your PostgreSQL database.
    * **Secure Deletion:** When deleting audio files, ensure they are securely removed and not just logically deleted. Object storage typically handles this.
    * **Access Control:**
        * **Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to backend services accessing storage and models.
        * **User Isolation:** Ensure users can only access their own audio files and transcripts. Implement robust authentication and authorization checks.
    * **Audit Logging:** Log all access and modifications to sensitive data (audio files, transcripts). This is crucial for compliance and security monitoring.

* **Processing Security (Secure model execution environment, data leakage prevention, model output sanitization, privacy compliance)?**
    * **Secure Execution Environment:**
        * **Containerization:** Docker/Kubernetes provides isolation for workers.
        * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the processing environment from other parts of your infrastructure.
        * **Regular patching:** Keep operating systems, libraries, and frameworks up to date.
    * **Data Leakage Prevention:** Ensure workers do not inadvertently store or log sensitive user data beyond what's necessary. Sanitize logs.
    * **Model Output Sanitization:** While STT models produce text, ensure no unintended sensitive information is accidentally passed through or stored in an unsecured manner.
    * **Privacy Compliance (GDPR, CCPA):**
        * **Consent:** Obtain clear consent from users for audio recording and processing.
        * **Data Minimization:** Only collect and store data absolutely necessary for the service.
        * **Right to Access/Erasure:** Implement mechanisms for users to access and delete their data (including audio and transcripts).
        * **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** If using third-party services (like HuggingFace Inference API, cloud storage), ensure DPAs are in place.
        * **Transparency:** Clearly state your data handling practices in your privacy policy.
        * **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Consider if parts of the data can be anonymized or pseudonymized to reduce privacy risk, especially for internal analytics.

### Monitoring & Analytics

#### Processing Metrics

* **Performance Monitoring (Processing time per file, model accuracy, resource utilization, user satisfaction)?**
    * **Processing Time:** Track `upload_to_complete_time`, `queue_time`, `transcription_time_per_second_of_audio`.
    * **Model Accuracy:** Periodically calculate WER on a test set. Monitor user feedback on accuracy.
    * **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, GPU (VRAM, utilization) for all workers and the main backend server.
    * **User Satisfaction:** Track feedback, error reports, and feature usage.

* **Business Metrics (Processing volume, cost per transcription, user conversion, feature usage)?**
    * **Processing Volume:** Number of audio files processed, total audio duration processed daily/weekly/monthly.
    * **Cost per Transcription:** Calculate infrastructure costs (GPU, storage, network) divided by total processed audio duration. Essential for understanding profitability.
    * **User Conversion:** Track free-to-paid conversions, and how transcription usage correlates with premium subscriptions.
    * **Feature Usage:** Which STT quality tiers are most popular? How often are transcripts edited?

#### Tools:
* **Logging:** ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana Loki, Datadog.
* **Metrics:** Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, New Relic.
* **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Slack/Email integrations.
* **Tracing (for distributed systems):** OpenTelemetry, Jaeger.

## Questions Requiring Immediate Decision

1.  **STT model selection:**
    * **Decision:** Start with **Whisper `large-v2`** for its out-of-the-box accuracy and multilingual support. This provides a strong baseline.
    * **Rationale:** It offers excellent general-purpose performance, allowing you to focus on building the pipeline. Be prepared to monitor its resource usage and explore Wav2Vec2 variants for specific optimizations or fine-tuning down the line if performance/cost becomes a significant bottleneck.
    * **Deployment Strategy:** Plan for **local model hosting** using GPUs for production, likely starting with one or more NVIDIA T4/V100 instances in the cloud.

2.  **Job queue system choice:**
    * **Decision:** **Celery with Redis as the broker.**
    * **Rationale:** Celery's maturity, extensive features (retries, monitoring, prioritization), and scalability make it the most robust choice for an industrial backend. Redis is a high-performance, widely adopted broker that's relatively easy to set up.

3.  **Storage architecture:**
    * **Decision:** **Object storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) for audio files, PostgreSQL for transcripts.**
    * **Rationale:** Object storage provides unmatched scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness for binary audio data. PostgreSQL is well-suited for structured transcript data, supporting features like JSONB for flexible word-level details and full-text search.

4.  **Progress tracking mechanism:**
    * **Decision:** **Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress updates from the backend to the mobile app.**
    * **Rationale:** Simpler to implement for unidirectional status updates than WebSockets, with built-in browser reconnection. The primary source of truth for status will be the PostgreSQL database.

5.  **Error handling strategy:**
    * **Decision:** Implement **automatic retries with exponential backoff (via Celery), a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for persistently failed tasks, and **comprehensive structured logging** to a centralized system.
    * **Rationale:** This ensures resilience against transient failures, prevents data loss, and provides critical information for debugging and improving system reliability.
