# Phase 1: Backend Foundation Setup (MVP) - Refined
# AgentLang program based on answered architectural questions

# MVP Constraints from answers:
# - FastAPI framework
# - Firestore (NoSQL) for data + audio storage
# - Neo4j for graph relationships only
# - No authentication (MVP)
# - Background tasks (no Celery/Redis)
# - Monolithic architecture
# - Dev environment only
# - Docker for cloud deployment
# - RESTful APIs with chunked upload
# - File-based configuration
# - Extensive Python logging

# Input: phase1_questions.md with architectural decisions
