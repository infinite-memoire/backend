# MVP Technology Stack - Hierarchical Breakdown

Based on Phase 1 architectural decisions from answered questions:

## 1. Core Framework & Architecture
### 1.1 Web Framework
- **FastAPI** - High-performance async Python framework
  - Built-in async support for long-running AI processing
  - WebSocket support for real-time progress updates
  - Automatic API documentation generation
  - High-performance audio file handling capabilities

### 1.2 Architecture Pattern
- **Monolithic Architecture** - Simple, robust design for MVP
  - Single deployable unit
  - Reduced complexity for initial development
  - Easy debugging and maintenance

## 2. Data Storage Strategy
### 2.1 Primary Database
- **Firestore (NoSQL)** - Unified data storage
  - Audio files and metadata storage
  - Transcript storage with optional temporal markers (ISO format)
  - User data management
  - Flexible schema for evolving requirements

### 2.2 Graph Database
- **Neo4j** - Specialized graph relationships
  - Storyline graph generation from transcripts
  - Node-to-transcript chunk ID linking
  - Chapter identification through edge analysis
  - Temporal relationship modeling

### 2.3 Data Synchronization
- **ID-based linking** between Firestore and Neo4j
  - No complex synchronization required
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Transcript chunks in Firestore linked to graph nodes via IDs

## 3. Authentication & Security (MVP Simplification)
### 3.1 Authentication Strategy
- **No authentication** for MVP
  - Simplified development and testing
  - Focus on core functionality
  - Authentication to be added in later phases

### 3.2 Security Approach
- **Permissive CORS** for mobile app integration
  - Open API access for development
  - No rate limiting initially
  - No file upload size restrictions

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment
### 4.1 Environment Management
- **Development environment only**
  - Single environment for MVP development
  - No complex environment management
  - Local development setup

### 4.2 Containerization
- **Docker for cloud deployment**
  - Local development without containers
  - Dockerfiles for cloud deployment ready
  - No database seeding or complex setup

### 4.3 Task Processing
- **FastAPI Background Tasks**
  - No Celery or Redis complexity
  - Async event queuing for simple job management
  - Background processing for AI operations

## 5. API Design & Integration
### 5.1 API Architecture
- **RESTful API design**
  - Simple, standards-based endpoints
  - No GraphQL complexity
  - No WebSocket endpoints initially

### 5.2 File Upload Strategy
- **Chunked upload** support
  - Large audio file handling
  - No progress tracking or resume capability initially
  - Simple audio format validation

### 5.3 Mobile Integration
- **Direct API consumption** by Flutter mobile app
  - No pagination for MVP
  - Simple request/response patterns

## 6. Configuration & Operations
### 6.1 Configuration Management
- **File-based configuration**
  - Non-secret values in config files
  - Secret values in configuration files
  - Simple setup for team members

### 6.2 Logging & Monitoring
- **Extensive Python logging**
  - Quick and easy debugging
  - No complex monitoring initially
  - Standard Python logging patterns

### 6.3 Testing Strategy
- **No formal testing** for MVP
  - Manual testing and validation
  - Focus on rapid development
  - Testing to be added in later phases

## 7. Development Workflow
### 7.1 Code Organization
- **Simple, robust structure**
  - No over-engineering
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easy to understand and maintain

### 7.2 Dependency Management
- **Standard Python requirements**
  - pip/poetry for dependency management
  - Minimal external dependencies
  - Focus on proven, stable packages
