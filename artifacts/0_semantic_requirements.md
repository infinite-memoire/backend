# Root Cause Analysis: Semantic Requirements for AI Processing System

## Observation

The current Phase 2 audio implementation provides a solid foundation for audio processing with STT capabilities, but lacks the semantic analysis and AI processing pipeline required for converting transcripts into organized book chapters. The system can successfully:

- Process audio files through validation, standardization, and chunking
- Transcribe audio using Whisper and Wav2Vec2 models with intelligent fallback
- Manage background tasks with Celery queues
- Handle file uploads with chunked processing

However, the system cannot extract meaning, create storylines, or generate organized content from the transcripts.

## Cause

The core gap is the absence of semantic processing capabilities that bridge the raw transcript output to meaningful content organization. Specifically missing:

1. **Semantic Chunking Pipeline**: While the audio system chunks by time/size, there's no semantic boundary detection
2. **Graph-based Storyline Analysis**: No mechanism to identify relationships, themes, and narrative structures in transcripts
3. **Temporal Information Extraction**: No capability to parse dates, times, and chronological references from natural language
4. **Multi-agent Content Generation**: No framework for coordinated AI agents to write and harmonize chapters

## Evidence

> "The backend does run the AI processing using an AI agentic system... semantic chunking of the input text using rolling window... identify the main storylines in the text by creating a graph from the textual recordings"

The development plan clearly outlines these requirements, but the current implementation focuses only on audio-to-transcript conversion without the downstream AI processing pipeline.

## Next Steps

Implement the missing semantic processing components:

1. **Semantic Text Analysis Module**: For meaningful text chunking and boundary detection
2. **Graph Database Integration**: Neo4j schema and operations for storyline analysis 
3. **Multi-Agent System Architecture**: Framework for Chapter Writer, Harmonizer, and Follow-up Questions agents
4. **Temporal Processing Pipeline**: NLP-based date/time extraction and timeline construction
5. **Agent Coordination System**: Message passing and workflow orchestration for multi-agent collaboration

These components will transform the raw transcripts into organized, meaningful content suitable for book generation.
